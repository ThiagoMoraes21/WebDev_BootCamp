# WebDev_BootCamp

I'm taking one of the udemy's programming courses. This one calls "The Web Developer Bootcamp" by Colt Steele.
This course covers the basics of full stack developer technologies such as HTML, CSS, JS, NodeJS, Databases with MongoDB, API's, and Deploying. 

The follows the MEAN stack, MEN in this case because it doens't cover Angular.
