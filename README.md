# WebDev_BootCamp

I'm taking one of the udemy's programming courses. This one calls "The Web Developer Bootcamp" by Colt Steele.
This course covers the basics of full stack developer world, wich is HTML, CSS, JS, NodeJS, Databases with MongoDB, API's,
Deploying and a bit more. 

The course have focus on the MEAN stack, MEN in this case because it doens't cover AngularJS.

I'm almost fishing, wish me luck xD.
